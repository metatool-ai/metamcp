# Recent Updates and background

From the author:

TL;DR: development on this project will be slow, but the project is still maintained.

I want to apologize for being slow developing/replying to issues/merging PRs in last 2 months+ and say thank you for all of your support and contributions. MetaMCP has received so many feedbacks that even I tried to convert to full-time and I still cannot handle all the load. So I was out looking for funding for a while which drags my development too. Then I have to looking for some job and joined a startup as co-founder and was busy in a 6-week launch sprint and I am finally back. But my full-time job will be busy too.

If I cannot convert this to a startup with funding, I think I would rather reduce the amount of reading of all different feedbacks as I cannot fully address them and would like to only help community merge PRs (don't want to make aggressive new feature but introduce new bugs that we cannot resolve). And I would consider being stealth again for a while and only release more production ready, signicant changes/new projects if I made it.

In the meanwhile I suggest you take a look at these 2 blogs from Anthropic and they are also proposing ways to solve problems that MetaMCP tried to solve, although not exactly the same. (https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills and https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp).

Speaking of this, I think let's try to maintain he main 2.4 branch than the docker out of docker branch as it is never invested enough time.

Feel free to ping me for any questions.

Best,
James
